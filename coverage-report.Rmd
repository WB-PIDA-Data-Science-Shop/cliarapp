### Introduction

The Country Level Institutional Assessment and Review (CLIAR) is a methodological framework designed to make the Bank's institutional diagnostic work and policy dialogue at the country level more integrated and data-driven. The aim of CLIAR's institutional analysis is to support the World Bank's policy dialogue with counterparts and help identify entry points and priorities for institutional reform.

The primary objective of this Coverage Report is to address the question: "Which indicators are available for which years?" By assessing data availability across clusters, this report provides a detailed view of the extent and quality of coverage for key indicators that inform CLIAR country diagnostics. This analysis is relevant for identifying gaps and prioritizing efforts to improve data availability with counterparts, ensuring a more robust foundation for policy dialogue and decision-making.

This report is divided into three key sections. **Section i. Data Update Frequency and Timing** provides a context table exploring the data update cycles for the data sources that construct the indicators and their frequency of publication. Understanding these update cycles is crucial for evaluating data timeliness and identifying potential limitations in the analysis of the following sections. **Section ii. Data Coverage Summary: Proportions Across Clusters** presents an overview table displaying the proportion of indicators shared per cluster, offering a high-level overview of data coverage. Finally, **Section iii. Temporal Insights: Yearly Coverage within Clusters** provides a sharper picture of the clusters using heat maps to visualize the availability of specific indicators across years. Together, these sections aim to provide a global understanding of the current data landscape, highlight temporal trends in data coverage, and pinpoint gaps that require complementary data or action from the institutions that generate the indicators to consider publishing the data.

## i. Data Update Frequency and Timing

To provide context for the analysis of data coverage, it is essential to understand the update frequency and timing of the data sources that construct the indicators used in the CLIAR framework. The table below summarizes the latest year available on the dashboard for each manual data source, along with their expected publication cycles. This information helps to assess the timeliness of the data and identify potential limitations in the analysis.

| Manual Data Extraction (sources)   | Latest year on dashboard | Expected Publication cycle |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Fraser Institute                   | 2022                     | Annual                     |
| Heritage Index of Economic Freedom | 2024                     | Annual                     |
| Open Budget Survey                 | 2023                     | Bi-annually                |
| RISE                               | 2021                     | Bi-annually                |
| Romelli                            | 2023                     | Academic Source            |
| SPI                                | 2023                     | Bi-annually                |
| V-DEM                              | 2024                     | Annually                   |
| WBL: Women, Business and the Law   | 2024                     | Annually                   |
| WDI                                | 2024                     | Annually                   |

Additionally, in the context of out methodology note, to understand indicator-level data availability and expected Publication Cycles within the Country Level Institutional Assessment and Review (CLIAR) framework, consult the [Indicators Definition](https://w0lxdrconn01.worldbank.org/CLIAR_UAT/){refer section Methodology & User Guide - List of Indicators} file for a comprehensive overview. For data sourced directly from Prosperity Data 360 via their API, indicator-specific metadata is available in the [Resources section](https://prosperitydata360.worldbank.org/en/resources), enabling case-by-case examination. This information complements the following sections of this report, which detail data update frequency, overall coverage across clusters, and yearly coverage within each cluster.
